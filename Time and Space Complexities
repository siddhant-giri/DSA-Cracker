Big O Notation --> Upper bound (gets you the worst case complexity)
Theta Notation --> Average case complexity
Omega Notation --> Lower Bound

Constant Time - O(1)
Linear Time - O(n)
Logarithmic Time - O(log n)
Quadratic Time - O(n^2)
Cubic Time - O(n^3)


Least to Highest complexity

O(1) -> O(log n) -> O(n) -> O(n log n) -> O(n^2) -> O(n^3) -> O(2^n) -> O(n!)
